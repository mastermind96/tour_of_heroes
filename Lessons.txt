Concepts I Have Learned
	->Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
	->Create Angular components.
	->Create a  Service :(Since components should focus on presenting data):Modularity
											:Removing data access from components means you can change your mind about the implementation anytime, without touching any components. They don't know how the service works.
	->Use One-Way binding(for read-only data)
	->Synchronous programming: unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress
	->Update model with two-way data binding(for editable text-fields)
	->Bind component methods to events(keystrokes/clicks)
	->Make changes to the data model
	->Pipes??
	->Create shared service?
	->Routing?
